# Ultra-Sonic-Radar
This project is a radar simulation system built using an Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), and the Processing IDE to visualize detected objects in a radar-style display. It demonstrates how to combine hardware and software to detect and visualize object distance and position in a semi-circular radar view.
